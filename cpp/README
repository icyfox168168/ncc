This preprocessor is fully conformant to ANSI C89/ISO C90, except:

	- trigraphs are unrecognized, and
	- wide characters/string literals are not recognized.

These features were deliberately omitted, on the grounds that they're stupid.

This code should be architecturally sound, though it has not been extensively
tested or performance tuned. There are undoubtedly many lurking [minor] bugs.
